# UNIBA Academic Design System

You are designing a university study program website for Universitas Batam (UNIBA).
This is NOT a startup landing page.

Design must feel:
- Academic
- Formal
- Clean
- Professional
- Minimal color contrast

## Color System (Tailwind)

Hero Section:
bg-gradient-to-b from-primary-50 via-white to-white

Default Section:
bg-white

Alternate Section:
bg-slate-50

CTA Section:
bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-600 to-primary-700 text-white

## Rules

- Use primary blue as main color
- Yellow is accent only (badges / highlights)
- Green is minor accent only
- DO NOT use purple, pink, or random gradients
- DO NOT alternate dark/light sections aggressively
- Avoid marketing-style layouts

## Hero Layout Rules

Hero contains:
- Eyebrow text
- Program Study Title
- Short academic description
- CTA buttons
- Small contact metadata

Hero must stay clean and minimal.

## Section Layout Rules

Sections use:
- max-w-6xl container
- rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl
- ring-1 instead of heavy borders
- shadow-sm or shadow-md only

## Component Philosophy

Hero = Branding
Quick Info = Academic Metadata
Sections = Content

Never duplicate academic info between Hero and Quick Info.

## Tailwind Style

Prefer:
bg-white
bg-slate-50
text-slate-900
ring-slate-200

Avoid flashy gradients or startup aesthetics.
